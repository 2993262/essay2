# Introduction: Observing Instruments

Since the start of science humans have wanted to explore the universe beyond our immediate reach. Observing instruments have played an important role in this journey to enable us to investigate further into space and find the mysteries of the universe.From the first simple telescopes to today’s advanced telescopes, these tools have made our understanding of the universe better. This exploration begins with the development of telescopes, including both optical and radio varieties, and continues with advancements in visible-light detectors and instruments. As our curiosity pushes beyond the limitations of Earth's atmosphere, space-based observations have opened new possibilitiess. Looking ahead the future of large telescopes promises even greater discoveries, offering a view into the most distant covers of space and time.

# Telescopes

Astronomy undergo a sea change with the development of the telescope in the early 17th century. Galileo Galilei was one of the first to observe the night sky with a telescope, finding the phases of Venus and the moons orbiting Jupiter. Astronomers can study planets, stars, and galaxies in greater detail thanks to telescopes which gather and magnify light from far-off objects. Refracting telescopes which use lenses and reflecting telescopes  which use mirrors are the two main categories of optical telescopes. While each has advantages and disadvantages, they both perform the basic role of collecting light to show dim objects. The telescope's aperture or lens or mirror size controls how much light it can gather and how sharp the image will be.Larger apertures allow astronomers to see deeper into space and capture more details of the celestial phenomena.

# Telescopes today

Modern telescopes are a far cry from the early designs of Galileo. " Chapt3 Most Of the big telescopes now a days are reflectors and can have much more light collection than any in the several hundred years ago. They typically have fancy technology such as motorized mounts, adaptive optics to correct for distortions in the atmosphere and computerized systems to accurately aim. Several are in isolated places, such as the Atacama Desert or Mauna Kea, to minimize light and atmospheric pollution. Robotic telescopes can be remotely and automatically operated, such that the access of human astronomers is not actually required on site for observing. It is even possible to link these telescopes in distributed world-wide networks which collaborate. Modern reflective telescopes have segmented mirrors that can reconfigure themselves in real-time so as to maintain the clarity of the image.Together these changes allow for better accuracy or efficiency and collaboration astronomical research.
