# Introduction: Observing Instruments

Since the start of science humans have wanted to explore the universe beyond our immediate reach. Observing instruments have played an important role in this journey to enable us to investigate further into space and find the mysteries of the universe.From the first simple telescopes to today’s advanced telescopes, these tools have made our understanding of the universe better. This exploration begins with the development of telescopes, including both optical and radio varieties, and continues with advancements in visible-light detectors and instruments. As our curiosity pushes beyond the limitations of Earth's atmosphere, space-based observations have opened new possibilitiess. Looking ahead the future of large telescopes promises even greater discoveries, offering a view into the most distant covers of space and time.

# Telescopes

Astronomy undergo a sea change with the development of the telescope in the early 17th century. Galileo Galilei was one of the first to observe the night sky with a telescope, finding the phases of Venus and the moons orbiting Jupiter. Astronomers can study planets, stars, and galaxies in greater detail thanks to telescopes which gather and magnify light from far-off objects. Refracting telescopes which use lenses and reflecting telescopes  which use mirrors are the two main categories of optical telescopes. While each has advantages and disadvantages, they both perform the basic role of collecting light to show dim objects. The telescope's aperture or lens or mirror size controls how much light it can gather and how sharp the image will be.Larger apertures allow astronomers to see deeper into space and capture more details of the celestial phenomena.

# Telescopes today

Modern telescopes are a far cry from the early designs of Galileo. " Chapt3 Most Of the big telescopes now a days are reflectors and can have much more light collection than any in the several hundred years ago. They typically have fancy technology such as motorized mounts, adaptive optics to correct for distortions in the atmosphere and computerized systems to accurately aim. Several are in isolated places, such as the Atacama Desert or Mauna Kea, to minimize light and atmospheric pollution. Robotic telescopes can be remotely and automatically operated, such that the access of human astronomers is not actually required on site for observing. It is even possible to link these telescopes in distributed world-wide networks which collaborate. Modern reflective telescopes have segmented mirrors that can reconfigure themselves in real-time so as to maintain the clarity of the image.Together these changes allow for better accuracy or efficiency and collaboration astronomical research.

# Visible Light Detectors and Instruments:

<img src=“https://github.com/sphemakh-astrolab/md-essay-the-peaky-blinders/blob/c4592f932899b16eeb7182e8a46fc647afff7d74/Visible-Light%20Detector.jpg”>> play a vital role in contemporary astronomy. Optical telescopes such as refractors and reflectors collect and focus visible light produced by celestial objects. The first purpose of a telescope is to gather light followed by its secondary purpose of interpreting good details. Typically larger telescopes offer the best resolution and are capable of collecting the greatest amounts of light. Detectors like charge coupled devices (CCDs) are commonly found on these telescopes as they change incoming photons into electronic signals that can be processed to create images. long exposure astrophotography and deep sky photography. Astronomers are able to identify the structure, temperature, and speed of objects in space by using spectrographs which separate light into its separate wavelengths. Another needed tool for identifying events like variable stars and planets crosses is a photometer which measures the brightnes of stars over time.

# Radio telescopes:

detect radio waves from many kinds of objects in space and see the universe at much longer wavelengths. Usually they are made up of big parabolic dishes that gather weak radio waves from the sky. Compared to visible light telescopes radio telescopes have less impact by atmospheric conditions and can be used day or night. They have been in the job of finding quasars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation among other astronomical events. Radio interferometry is the process by which arrays such as the Very Large Array (VLA) combine the signals from multiple dishes to create high resolution images. More detailed explanation can be found under the following link. https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/radio-telescopes

Together radio and visible-light telescopes provide identical views of the cosmos. Radio telescopes investigate the invisible universe by following the smallest signals across space and time while visible light telescopes relate the activity and structure of bright objects.


# Observations at extraterrestrial sites outside the Earth's atmosphere

The Earth’s atmosphere absorbs or bends many of the wavelengths of radiation, which is why space-based telescopes are essential for a full picture of the universe. The Hubble Space Telescope, operational since 1990, is still one of the most influential astronomical tools, providing high-resolution pictures in visible, ultraviolet and near-infrared light. In order to study wavelengths that the Earth’s surface does not see, astronomers have built unique style telescopes. Chandra X-ray Observatory for instance captures hot spots around black holes and supernova remnants. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is obviously going to look through the dust and picture light from the earliest galaxies in the universe.Telescopes operating in these other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum must be positioned above Earth's atmosphere. Such telescopes are typically launched on rockets or carried into orbit by space shuttles. Some infrared telescopes are carried high into the atmosphere by balloons or airplanes like SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy), which is mounted in a Boeing 747SP jetliner.

# The Future of Big Telescopes

The future of the observational part of astronomy depends on the construction of next generation ground based telescopes, such as the ELT (Extremely Large Telescope), the TMT (Thirty Meter Telescope), or the GMT (Giant Magellan Telescope). Those will offer more-detailed views of exoplanets, galaxies and dark matter.

These new observatories are built on mountain tops in remote areas where the air is dry and the sky is dark. They rely on adaptive optics systems that correct for the distortions introduced by Earth’s atmosphere, enabling astronomers to capture images as sharp as those taken from space. Coupled with high performance computing resources, these developments will provide us with an extensive envelope of everything that happens in the Universe.

# conclusion

Telescopes have indeed illuminated the universe. Since the days of early optical telescopes to the current physical observatories deployed in space, these were the instruments that let us see an untold number of phenomena in their full cosmic glory. With telescopes that capture light we see and telescopes sensitive to radio waves, astronomers can study the universe in light of all wavelengths, and telescopes like Hubble, Chandra, and JWST break free of the atmosphere entirely. Next-generation telescopes—like the ELT, TMT and GMT—will enable researchers to study farther away galaxies, exoplanets and dark matter. And as we develop new technologies, we increase our ability to explore and make sense of the cosmos. Observatories continue to play a vital role in mankind’s never-ending quest to reveal the secrets of space and time.
